Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement control. It is one of the most common neurological disorders, with an estimated 10 million people affected worldwide. The disease is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, which leads to symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. In addition to motor symptoms, Parkinson’s can also affect non-motor functions, including speech, mood, and cognitive abilities.

Early diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease is critical for effective management, as early intervention can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and slow the progression of symptoms. However, diagnosing PD in its early stages remains a challenge. Symptoms such as mild tremors, changes in speech patterns, and subtle gait abnormalities can often be misattributed to other conditions or go unnoticed entirely. Currently, the diagnosis of PD relies on clinical evaluation and observation of motor symptoms, which can be subjective and prone to misinterpretation, especially when symptoms are not fully developed.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising solutions to address these challenges. By analyzing large volumes of patient data, including speech recordings, motor movement patterns, and sensor data, machine learning algorithms can identify subtle signs of Parkinson’s Disease that may not be immediately apparent to healthcare providers. These algorithms can provide objective, data-driven insights, enabling early and more accurate detection of the disease.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for the early detection and continuous monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease. The proposed system integrates multiple data sources, such as voice analysis, gait analysis, and wearable sensor data, to identify early-stage symptoms of PD. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks, the system will be trained to recognize patterns and predict the likelihood of Parkinson’s Disease with high accuracy.

In addition to its potential for early diagnosis, the system will also facilitate continuous monitoring of patients, helping clinicians track disease progression over time and adjust treatment plans accordingly. This project seeks to contribute to the growing body of research focused on using machine learning for medical diagnostics, specifically for Parkinson’s Disease, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes and enabling more personalized treatment strategies.
